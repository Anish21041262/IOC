Here are **10 detailed steps** outlining how the Prometei Linux botnet attack unfolds, based on the Unit 42 analysis and corroborating sources:

1. **Initial Exploitation**
   Attackers identify and leverage entry points‚Äîoften via brute‚Äëforcing credentials or exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities like EternalBlue or SMB bugs‚Äîto gain access to a Linux host ([unit42.paloaltonetworks.com][1]).

2. **Malware Delivery via HTTP GET**
   Once access is obtained, the compromised system sends an HTTP GET request to a malicious server (e.g., `hxxp://103.41.204[.]104/k.php?a=x86_64`). This request fetches a custom UPX-packed ELF binary ([unit42.paloaltonetworks.com][1]).

3. **Dynamic Configuration Injection**
   Each request returns an executable with randomized embedded configuration (including a unique `ParentID`), helping the malware distinguish bots and evade static detection ([securityaffairs.com][2], [unit42.paloaltonetworks.com][1]).

4. **Disguised File Naming & Obfuscation**
   The payload in disguised PHP-like filenames (`k.php`) is actually a Linux ELF executable. UPX packing is used to compress and obfuscate the malware further, complicating static analysis ([unit42.paloaltonetworks.com][1]).

5. **In-Memory Unpacking**
   At runtime, the UPX-packed ELF decompresses, loading its payload into memory without writing the full malicious binary to disk‚Äîevading many disk-based scanners ([securityaffairs.com][2], [unit42.paloaltonetworks.com][1]).

6. **Backdoor Activation**
   After unpacking, Prometei initializes a backdoor, enabling module-based capabilities such as C2 communication, mining, lateral movement, and data theft ([unit42.paloaltonetworks.com][1]).

7. **System Reconnaissance**
   The bot collects host details (CPU, motherboard, uptime, kernel version, OS info) and sends this telemetry via HTTP GET to its C2 infrastructure to customize further actions .

8. **Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) for C2**
   To ensure reliable communication even if domains are blacklisted, the malware uses a DGA to periodically compute new C2 domain names, enhancing resilience ([unit42.paloaltonetworks.com][1]).

9. **Self-Updating & Modular Expansion**
   Modules can be dynamically downloaded and updated (e.g., mining, credential theft). This ‚Äúself-updating‚Äù behavior allows attackers to adapt their goals over time ([unit42.paloaltonetworks.com][1]).

10. **Persistent Cryptocurrency Mining & Data Theft**
    Finally, the malware establishes persistence (via cron or services), deploys a Monero miner, and may exfiltrate credentials or other data back to the C2‚Äîmaximizing financial gain ([securityweek.com][3]).

---

### üîç Summary

* The attack starts with gaining access (credential brute-force or exploiting vulnerabilities).
* Malware downloads a UPX-packed ELF disguised behind a PHP script name.
* The payload unpacks itself in memory, initializes a backdoor, and performs system reconnaissance.
* It uses a DGA and updates itself dynamically, loading modules for mining (Monero), stealing data, and exfiltration.
* Ultimately, the bot establishes persistence and carries out its monetization objectives.
