Ransomheb ransomware 

Ransomhub appeared as the most organized and large ransomware group in early 2025, filled zero again by Lockbit and Alphvi. More than 222 attacks were claimed and 27 confirmed, showing strong operating discipline and global access. It is believed that many of the colleagues are considered a former member of inadequate groups, which contributes to the various attacking strategies. Ransomhubs encrypts are very effective, and the leaked website message is still calculated. It targets many areas, including production, authorities and health care.
