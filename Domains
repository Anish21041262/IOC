Clop ransomware surged back into prominence with a record-breaking campaign In H1 2025, that exploited critical zero-day vulnerabilities in Cleo Managed File Transfer (MFT) solutions (CVE-2024-50623 and CVE-2024-55956). The group was responsible for 35% of all victims listed on data-leak sites in February alone, marking a staggering 1,400% increase in activity compared to late 2024. 

Clop primarily targeted organizations in the manufacturing, retail, and transportation sectors, with a heavy concentration in the United States (72%). Known for its burst-style operations, Clopâ€™s tactics included data exfiltration, supply chain disruption, and tailored ransom demands, making it one of the most impactful ransomware groups in early 2025.
