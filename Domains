APT 36, also known as Transparent Tribe, is a Pakistan-linked Advanced Persistent Threat group active since 2013. Their operations focus on espionage against Indian military, government, and educational institutions. Using malware like Crimson RAT and CapraRAT, they infiltrate systems to exfiltrate sensitive data, monitor communications, and compromise strategic assets. Their persistent campaigns pose a long-term threat to India's national security infrastructure. 

Indiaâ€™s critical infrastructure including power grids, telecom networks, and healthcare systems is increasingly vulnerable to cyber sabotage. Threat actors deploy ransomware, phishing, and supply chain attacks to disrupt essential services. These multi-vector assaults not only threaten operational continuity but also aim to erode public trust in digital governance and emergency response capabilities. 

In response to rising cyber threats, regional governments and cybersecurity agencies have intensified threat intelligence sharing to improve situational awareness and response coordination. This includes real-time exchange of indicators of compromise (IOCs), tactics, and threat actor profiles. Additionally, efforts have been made to harden critical infrastructure, such as telecom, energy, and defense systems, through enhanced monitoring, patching, and segmentation strategies to reduce attack surfaces. 

Governments and cybersecurity alliances in South Asia are increasingly prioritizing early threat detection through AI-driven analytics, honeypots, and threat hunting operations. Simultaneously, cyber diplomacy is gaining traction, with countries engaging in dialogue to establish norms, share best practices, and collaborate on cross-border incident response. This dual approach strengthens both technical and strategic resilience against evolving cyber threats.
