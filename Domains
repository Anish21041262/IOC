The first half of 2025 saw a dramatic escalation in cyber threats targeting Operational Technology (OT) and Internet of Things (IoT) environments. Attackers leveraged automation and AI-driven tools to conduct reconnaissance and exploit vulnerabilities at unprecedented speed. Active scanning of OT/IoT protocols like Modbus TCP surged globally, with tools such as SIP Vicious weaponized to identify exposed services before patches could be applied. 

 

Adversaries now move from initial access to full network compromise in less than 24 hours, especially in industrial environments. This rapid progression is facilitated by automated botnets and ransomware variants tailored for OT/ICS systems.
