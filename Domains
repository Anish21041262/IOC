Here are **10 steps** outlining how a typical Scatteredâ€¯Spider (UNC3944) attack on an aviation or transportation target unfoldsâ€”each in 2â€“3 concise lines:

---

1. **Target reconnaissance (OSINT gathering)**
   The attackers start with open-source intelligence to gather detailed info on the organization, staff, IT support roles, and helpâ€‘desk procedures. They often mine LinkedIn, company websites, and forums. ([cybersecuritynews.com][1])

2. **Selecting entry point via IT help desk**
   They identify and zero in on helpâ€‘desk personnel as the weakest linkâ€”often through carefully researched impersonation profiles. ([bleepingcomputer.com][2])

3. **Impersonation using vishing or phishing**
   Attackers call (vishing) or email (phishing) help desk, pretending to be lockedâ€‘out employees needing urgent access. Their flawless English and cultural familiarity make them convincing. ([cybersecuritynews.com][1])

4. **Bypassing MFA via social engineering**
   They pressure IT staff to perform MFA resets or to register attacker-controlled devices, undermining security protocols like Windows Hello or SMS-based codes. ([cybersecuritynews.com][1])

5. **SIMâ€‘swap and MFA fatigue techniques**
   If MFA relies on mobile, they may use SIM-swapping or repeatedly trigger authentication prompts until the legitimate user approves out of annoyance or fatigue. ([cybersecuritynews.com][1])

6. **Account takeover & initial access**
   Once MFA is bypassed, they log in as internal users or IT staff, often gaining domain-level privileges through the compromised account. ([cybersecuritynews.com][1])

7. **Lateral movement with legitimate tools**
   Using built-in tools like PowerShell and PsExec, they move across systems ("living off the land") with minimal detection. ([cybersecuritynews.com][1])

8. **Targeting identity infrastructure**
   They compromise identity systemsâ€”Okta, AD, Azure ADâ€”to gain persistence and widespread administrative access across systems. ([cybersecuritynews.com][1])

9. **Data theft & ransomware deployment**
   Sensitive corporate, passenger, or flightâ€‘related data is exfiltrated and used as leverage, often alongside or before deploying extortion ransomware. ([cybernews.com][3])

10. **Extortion & public disclosure threat**
    Attackers demand ransom under threat of public leaks, targeting reputation-sensitive sectors like aviation. Authorities (e.g. FBI, Mandiant) often get involved during or postâ€‘incident.&#x20;

---

**ðŸ”’ Summary:** Scatteredâ€¯Spider leverages a **social-engineering-first** approachâ€”targeting help desk staff to bypass MFA, then escalates privileges, moves laterally using legitimate tools, and finally steals or encrypts data for extortion. Their attacks are methodical, sector-focused, and increasingly threat to critical industries such as aviation.
