APT 36, also known as Transparent Tribe, is a Pakistan-linked Advanced Persistent Threat group active since 2013. Their operations focus on espionage against Indian military, government, and educational institutions. Using malware like Crimson RAT and CapraRAT, they infiltrate systems to exfiltrate sensitive data, monitor communications, and compromise strategic assets. Their persistent campaigns pose a long-term threat to India's national security infrastructure. 

Indiaâ€™s critical infrastructure including power grids, telecom networks, and healthcare systems is increasingly vulnerable to cyber sabotage. Threat actors deploy ransomware, phishing, and supply chain attacks to disrupt essential services. These multi-vector assaults not only threaten operational continuity but also aim to erode public trust in digital governance and emergency response capabilities. 

In response to rising cyber threats, regional governments and cybersecurity agencies have intensified threat intelligence sharing to improve situational awareness and response coordination. This includes real-time exchange of indicators of compromise (IOCs), tactics, and threat actor profiles. Additionally, efforts have been made to harden critical infrastructure, such as telecom, energy, and defense systems, through enhanced monitoring, patching, and segmentation strategies to reduce attack surfaces. 

Governments and cybersecurity alliances in South Asia are increasingly prioritizing early threat detection through AI-driven analytics, honeypots, and threat hunting operations. Simultaneously, cyber diplomacy is gaining traction, with countries engaging in dialogue to establish norms, share best practices, and collaborate on cross-border incident response. This dual approach strengthens both technical and strategic resilience against evolving cyber threats. 






Apt 36, also known as a transparent tribe, has been active since 2013, a Pakistan-affiliated advanced threat group. Their business focuses on espionage against Indian military, authorities and educational institutions. By using harmful software such as Crimson Rats and Caprat, they infiltrate the system to ex -filter sensitive data, monitor communication and compromise strategic assets. Their frequent campaigns pose a long -term threat to India's national security infrastructure. 

India's important infrastructure, including Power Grid, Telecom Network and Healthcare System, is quickly unsafe for cybersabotage. The danger actors distribute ransomware, fishing and supply chain attacks to disrupt important services. These attacks on several vectors are not only hit operational continuity, but also aim to destroy public belief in digital regulatory and emergency preparedness skills. 

In response to rising cyber threats, regional authorities and cyber security agencies have intensified danger sharing to improve the status awareness and response coordination. This includes real -time exchange of indicators for the actress profile of the compromise (IOC), strategy and danger. In addition, attempts have been made to make important infrastructure such as telecom, energy and defense systems, through increased monitoring, patching and partition strategies to reduce the surfaces of the attack. 

Governments and cyber security alliances in South Asia prioritize the first threat through AI-operated analyzes, honeypots and danger surgeries. Along with this, cyber diplomacy receives traction, which engages in dialogue to establish the criteria, share best practices and collaborate on the limit -Cross -tile -event response. This double approach strengthens both technically and size
