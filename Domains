Here’s a structured breakdown—10 ways these attacks are executed in the African financial sector, each with supporting details:

---

1. **Phishing with HTML smuggling**
   Attackers send deceptive emails impersonating recruiters or bank staff, embedding HTML files that auto-download ISO payloads. Inside, a VBScript triggers in-memory malware like GuLoader via PowerShell and Registry abuse ([portswigger.net][1]).

2. **Business Email Compromise (BEC)**
   Groups like SilverTerrier in Nigeria target financial institutions through tailored phishing campaigns using compromised email accounts. They spoof trusted contacts, manipulate payment details, and reroute funds—often exploiting HR or finance channels ([en.wikipedia.org][2]).

3. **Supply chain compromise**
   Cybercriminals infiltrate third-party suppliers—e.g., devs on Discord or GitHub—embedding malware in library packages. Compromise cascades when banks download these components, initiating deeper intrusions ([b2bdaily.com][3]).

4. **DNS-based backdoors (Agent Racoon)**
   Attackers deploy .NET backdoors using DNS covert channels—randomly generated punycode subdomains—to communicate with C2 servers securely, then execute file transfer or command execution. No persistence until scheduled tasks set up ([unit42.paloaltonetworks.com][4]).

5. **Living-off-the-land tactics**
   Instead of custom malware, attackers abuse native tools like PowerShell, PsExec, RDP, Mimikatz, Cobalt Strike, Ultr\@VNC and legit admin tools to move laterally and evade detection ([security.com][5]).

6. **Information-stealer malware**
   Stealers like Raccoon, RedLine, Vidar, LummaC2 harvest browser-stored credentials, cookies, financial data, crypto wallets, and history. Stolen logs are either shared freely (UCLs) or sold in underground markets ([intelligentcio.com][6]).

7. **Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)**
   Attackers use RaaS platforms, enabling novices to execute ransomware campaigns with professional tooling, support, and infrastructure—mainly targeting banks and critical services for high payoff ([b2bdaily.com][3]).

8. **BEC combined with social engineering**
   Hybrid attacks start with phishing (email/text), then escalate via voice calls masquerading as bank support, pressuring the victim into actions that grant access or share credentials ([ptsecurity.com][7]).

9. **AI-enhanced impersonation and deepfakes**
   Criminals deploy AI-generated voices or synthetic images/videos to convincingly mimic executives or officials, boosting trust and effectiveness of social-engineering phishing ([unit42.paloaltonetworks.com][8], [www2.kaspersky.com][9]).

10. **Selling access on dark web and underground forums**
    Initial Access Brokers (IABs) sell network credentials (e.g. admin access for \~\$170–\$300) on underground forums. Other attackers buy access to deploy ransomware, steal data, or move laterally ([intelligentcio.com][6]).

These combined TTPs demonstrate a layered, evolving threat: initial compromise via phishing, credential harvesting, lateral moves with existing tools, and deployment of backdoors or ransomware—all supported by underground markets and sophisticated social-engineering aided by AI.
