RansomHub Ransomware 

RansomHub emerged as the most organized and dominant ransomware group in early 2025, filling the void left by LockBit and ALPHV. With over 222 attacks claimed and 27 confirmed, it demonstrated strong operational discipline and global reach. Many of its affiliates are believed to be former members of defunct groups, contributing to its diverse attack strategies. RansomHubâ€™s encryptors are highly effective, and its leak site messaging is threatening yet calculated. It targets a wide range of sectors, including manufacturing, government and healthcare.
