The emergence of hybrid danger-a step towards more complex multi-stage campaigns by combining ransomware with infosteals and computer extinction. Social techniques such as Clickfix and FakeCaptcha have exploited human errors in platforms and operating systems. This developed hazard landscape requires an active, intelligence -driven defense strategy that is outside the traditional circumference security.
