Here are **10 key steps** detailing how the LapDogs (ShortLeash) attack is executed. Each point offers a concise overview in 2–3 lines:

---

1. **Initial Access via Unpatched SOHO Devices**
   Attackers scan for internet-exposed, outdated Linux-based SOHO routers and embedded devices, exploiting vulnerabilities like CVE‑2015‑1548 and CVE‑2017‑17663 to gain entry ([advisory.eventussecurity.com][1]).

2. **Custom Backdoor Installation (ShortLeash)**
   Once inside, they deploy a bespoke backdoor named “ShortLeash” which grants high‑privileged, root-level access and establishes a persistent foothold ([securityscorecard.com][2]).

3. **Startup Script with Fake Services**
   A malicious Bash startup script is used to create pseudo-services for persistence, embedding Mandarin developer notes and auto-launching ShortLeash at each boot ([advisory.eventussecurity.com][1]).

4. **Dual-layer Payload Encryption**
   The backdoor payload is encrypted with two layers to evade detection and thwart forensic analysis, with hardcoded C2 locations embedded in the codebase ([advisory.eventussecurity.com][1]).

5. **Unique Self-Signed TLS Certs for Each Node**
   ShortLeash generates unique, self-signed TLS certificates per infected node, spoofing metadata to appear legitimate while separating each device’s identity ([securityscorecard.com][2]).

6. **Stealthy C2 Communications Over HTTPS**
   Infected devices communicate with command-and-control servers over encrypted web protocols, blending C2 traffic into normal HTTPS flows to evade network detection ([advisory.eventussecurity.com][1]).

7. **Operational Relay Box Network Formation**
   Compromised devices act as “Operational Relay Boxes” (ORBs), routing traffic and obfuscating attacker origins while allowing modular espionage tasks ([securityscorecard.com][2]).

8. **Deferred Tasking & Geographic Clustering**
   The network shows precise tasking schedules—feeding packets based on certificate dates and node port assignments, often focused regionally in the U.S., Japan, Taiwan, South Korea ([securityscorecard.com][2]).

9. **Data Gathering & Backup for Resilience**
   The backdoor collects system data, creates backups of critical configurations, and can exfiltrate archives of logs/files later—bolstered by root-level privilege to access everything ([securityscorecard.com][3]).

10. **Long-term Espionage Campaign**
    LapDogs is built for stealth and endurance, not noise—enabling espionage over months using thousands of nodes globally, all while avoiding typical indicators and remaining operative since Sept 2023 ([securityscorecard.com][2]).

These steps outline a methodical, covert, and targeted espionage infrastructure using compromised devices as a flexible, stealthy network. Let me know if you'd like deeper analysis on any step or specific technical IOCs!
