Here’s a **non-technical** version of the 10 steps based on the Fortinet article, explaining the Havoc attack in **simple terms** for better understanding:

---

### 1. **Fake Program Pretends to Be Real Windows File**

The attack begins by running a program that looks like a normal Windows file called `conhost.exe`, but it’s actually harmful. This trick helps the malware hide in plain sight so it doesn’t raise suspicion from users or antivirus software.

---

### 2. **Shows Help Info to Look Legit**

If this fake program is opened without instructions, it shows a fake help menu — like how real programs display help options. This makes it seem trustworthy and less likely to be noticed as dangerous.

---

### 3. **Quietly Opens a Real Windows Tool**

The fake program secretly opens another normal Windows tool called `cmd.exe`. On the surface, this tool appears safe, but the attacker is using it as a container to run hidden malicious code inside it.

---

### 4. **Unlocks the Hidden Malware**

The dangerous part of the program is stored in a scrambled (encrypted) form. Before it can do harm, the malware unlocks (decrypts) itself using a special code hidden in one of its files.

---

### 5. **Sneaks Into the Opened Windows Tool**

The malware then hides itself inside the `cmd.exe` tool it opened earlier. It moves its code into the tool quietly, without saving anything on the computer’s hard drive, making it harder to detect.

---

### 6. **Starts Running the Hidden Code**

Now that the malware is hiding inside the Windows tool, it secretly starts running by creating a new activity (a thread) inside the tool. This gives the attacker full control while remaining hidden.

---

### 7. **Gathers Basic Info About the Computer**

Once running, the malware gathers important details from the infected computer — like the computer’s name, who is logged in, network details, and what version of Windows is running.

---

### 8. **Sends Info to the Hacker’s Server**

The malware then sends this collected information to a server controlled by the attacker. This helps the hacker know exactly what kind of machine they have access to, and how they might use it.

---

### 9. **Keeps Checking In with the Hacker**

Every few seconds, the malware sends small messages to the hacker’s server to say “I’m still here.” This regular communication allows the hacker to stay connected and send new instructions at any time.

---

### 10. **Listens for Commands to Do More**

Now fully installed, the malware is ready to take orders — such as stealing files, taking screenshots, running new tools, or spying further. The hacker can extend its abilities at any time without being noticed.

---

### ✅ Summary:

The attacker uses a fake Windows file to secretly install malware on a computer. It hides well, talks to a hacker-controlled server, and waits for commands to steal information or do more damage. All of this happens without most users ever noticing.
